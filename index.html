        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>At the age of 19 I decided to join what we call military training in Sweden. There I gained knowledge in self-sufficiency, effective communication and problem solving. I also learnt the ability to preform under pressure. I believe the skills and knowledge I have achieved in my military training period will help me in my future career with data as I believe many of the skills are very much in common with technology.
          I then went on to gain a basic understanding of programming using the C# and python programming languages. I attended a course, there we created projects such as advanced calculator. Something I learnt in the process was by choosing to do a visual solution which gave me a good oversight to my coding.</p>

        <h2>Future Career</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student in BootCamp at University of Birmingham. My dedication to self-improvement in web design and development has inspired me to study web at a university, where I hope to incorporate new ideas with my own knowledge in a practical and beneficial way, as well as to add work to a future portfolio. I feel like I will be one step closer to making my dream come true in having a career as a web developer and be able to gain further education.
          I know how tough programming can be, but when the program finally works that satisfaction is immeasurable, it makes me want to develop the code further and make it more concise and elegant. </p>
